Why do I need this extension?

1. There are many reasons why a user should enable or disable some add-ons. For example:
    * There are add-ons that add additional elements to the Blender UI and in certain situations interfere and clutter Blender UI.
    * When there are too many add-ons, it can slow down the loading of Blender.
    * There is a possibility that some extensions may conflict with each other.
2. It is much more convenient when extensions are grouped and you can understand what category certain extensions belong to. (In Blender there is a filter by categories, but Add-ons Grouper gives the user the opportunity to set the category(group) to which certain add-on belongs)
